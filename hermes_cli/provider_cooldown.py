"""One owner for "the primary's credentials are all benched — route around it".

``resolve_runtime_provider`` reports a fully rate-limited credential pool by
annotating the runtime it hands back (``CREDENTIALS_COOLING_DOWN_KEY``); it
deliberately does not raise, because the same function also answers status
probes, model pickers and readiness checks, for which a cooling-down provider
is still a configured one.  Acting on that report is the caller's decision.

Three callers now own a fallback chain and need the identical answers -- the
gateway, cron jobs, and one-shot runs.  Duplicating the walk once per caller is
how the same entry starts resolving differently depending on who asked, so the
policy lives here and each caller supplies only its own chain.

The interactive CLI is deliberately NOT one of them yet: it wastes a request
per session the same way, but a long-lived session also has to decide when it
returns to the primary, and that is its own change.

The policy itself, in one line: a cooldown DEMOTES a provider, it does not
disqualify it.
